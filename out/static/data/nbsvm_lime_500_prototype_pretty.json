Deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, Howard Shore's creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0209958"}, {"class": "neg", "logits": [0.5352181587741113, 0.4647818412258887], "class_probabilities": [0.5352181587741113, 0.4647818412258887], "lime_scores": [0.017566569707707157, 0.0037036873602069227, 0.045746513391935965, 0.001210609427136786, 0.010281892393869467, 0.009565219708407183, 0.0016253355230579933, -0.1208981909909377, -0.023026417682862732], "lime_tokens": ["After you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies.", "Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film.", "I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later.", "Like \"Silence of the Lambs\" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, Like \"Flatliners\" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure.", "The surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen.", "And beyond this continuity and \"making sense\" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.", "The only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons.", "You actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man.", "The focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim."], "text": "After you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies.

I've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when I've been dancing and I suspect it would have been the same in the 18/19th century in Bath.\n\nI cannot believe the US/Canada reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout. The \"gothic\" scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly. I'm sure Jane A would be mildly amused by those reviews.

There's a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't deem their performance to be memorable. They're never at the best of their abilities.\n\nIf you don't expect too much, you'll certainly like this movie. It's no masterpiece but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance.

However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.\n\n The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts.

There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through pre-production of Northwestern and later his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says \"Sounds too much like oven,\") which he plans to use to raise money to complete Northwestern. This film's insight and humor is on par with Roger and Me, Michael Moore's great film. I first viewed it at a chaotic Sundance Film Festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay; half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up. Despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this fine film, worth sitting through any hellish screening.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0181288"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.3544080777350724, 0.6455919222649277], "class_probabilities": [0.3544080777350724, 0.6455919222649277], "lime_scores": [0.014367285081789652, 0.020856252851616866, 0.06353457901696763, 0.08465514791328649], "lime_tokens": ["American Movie is a wonderful documentary.", "It follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first film.", "The raw footage and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced.", "I also feel that the film can very inspirational to those of us that want to be filmmakers ourselves."], "text": "American Movie is a wonderful documentary.

It seemed sometimes like a Carnaby street romp 30 years later but I enjoyed the thrift shop Janis Joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun. The Iron John mens' group meetings are a bit dated but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old \"Carry On\" movies. The British know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition, unlike the United States which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0202285"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.42484635483231736, 0.5751536451676826], "class_probabilities": [0.42484635483231736, 0.5751536451676826], "lime_scores": [0.03768819110652228, 0.04026406146356068, 0.0364044698936189, -0.004125233722005088, 2.4045261408826845e-06, 0.0025858819756453943, 0.011398107236858985], "lime_tokens": ["An inspired choice of director for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of NY Dykes, _Go", "Fish_ brings a gently Jaundiced view to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths.", "The highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter-gatherers but end up ordering a take-away.", "The film as a whole is wonderfully acted and Troche, who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _", "Go", "Fish_'s grainy hyperkinesis.", "A really enjoyable film"], "text": "An inspired choice of director for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of NY Dykes, _Go Fish_ brings a gently Jaundiced view to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths.

Is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? Probably not. But for those of us who not only like our action, but also can appreciate a well told story, this is a big step forward for Seagal. It's almost like the transformation Clint Eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his \"Dirty Harry\" series. Either man, had he continued in the singular direction they were headed, would have forever been keyholed in in specific role and guaranteed the brevity of their careers...", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0120786"}, {"class": "neg", "logits": [0.5163084028228747, 0.4836915971771253], "class_probabilities": [0.5163084028228747, 0.4836915971771253], "lime_scores": [0.005720496517330517, -0.030884010519078294, 0.055375825149024935], "lime_tokens": ["I really enjoyed The Patriot.", "This movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization.", "One line in the movie from wesley mclaren (seagal) stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society, \"western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and I am in the business of curing it.\""], "text": "I really enjoyed The Patriot.

What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense.\n\nThe only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing.\n\nIf you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0182576"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.40026119078506633, 0.5997388092149336], "class_probabilities": [0.40026119078506633, 0.5997388092149336], "lime_scores": [0.0, -0.020917235710224635, -0.11410940119217829, 0.06892145549324621, 0.02162509825507347, 0.07713787345271408, 0.057607468146078304, -0.019074740660193674, -0.018925983553029976, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.023051695359489147, 0.022540885040213312], "lime_tokens": ["This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first one and have seen Curse, Legacy, and vs. Demonic Toys.", "The only one better than this one is PM vs. DT.", "Curse is the worst one in the series, Than the first one, and then its Legacy.", "I recommend people to see this and vs. DT.", "Those ones who say this stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it is a sweet movie.", "This is a classic movie even younger kids can watch and not be as scared when watching the others.", "Well this is my review, you can call me Gipdac,( its easy to know where that came from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can watch it on Toon Disney at 4:00 A.M.).", "Oh and don't laugh", ", I'm a guy, you will see more of my reviews in good time.", "If you want to know why I watch it?", "I'm 12!", "Word of advice:", "Have a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo!", "I also agree with you motter-1, but why people like the others is because they're more thrilling than horror, and because the puppets are made to look scarier.", "Also, you can call me Gipdac."], "text": "This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first one and have seen Curse, Legacy, and vs. Demonic Toys.

And when compared with the rest of the sitcoms airing right now \"War\" is an even better choice.\n\nIts appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. Teenagers have sex. Not every parent likes how their kids are turning out. Parents fight and call each other names. But rather than relying on being \"mean\" like many shows, everything is nice in the end which is the number one rule of a good sitcom.\n\nOne detraction from the show is the narration during/in between scenes. The \"Arrested Development/Family Guy\" style of flashbacks work well enough but the narration can be too much.\n\nSo anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday nights should check out \"The War at Home,\" especially considering what is on the other major networks at that time.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0460692"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.273109718840295, 0.7268902811597049], "class_probabilities": [0.273109718840295, 0.7268902811597049], "lime_scores": [0.057190184581218585, 0.01876456343761201, 0.07324773271956539, -0.03316951096095152, 0.02878297437927307, 0.03558094536034115, 0.04466897391782873, 0.014870598523981792, -0.01994420140966974, 0.020706550356517143], "lime_tokens": ["The War At Home is so good it's become my new favourite show.", "Me and my neighboors Carly and April watch this together every Sunday and laugh at how true to life it is.", "I love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issue.", "Once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family is.", "The father always harps on all three kids about every little thing.", "I love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids.", "It's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems", "just puts the show over the top.", "The War At Home is so brutally honest,and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come.", "This isn't Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life."], "text": "The War At Home is so good it's become my new favourite show.Me and my neighboors Carly and April watch this together every Sunday and laugh at how true to life it is.I love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issue.Once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family is.The father always harps on all three kids about every little thing.I love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids.It's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the top.The War At Home is so brutally honest,and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come.This isn't Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0460692"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.42320649438555447, 0.5767935056144454], "class_probabilities": [0.42320649438555447, 0.5767935056144454], "lime_scores": [0.2166725911518061, 0.0024389375292215446, 0.0067943092361021275, -0.005647161629628694, -0.09006380649831539, -0.01657505941854867, 0.0029183525350188412, -0.008384329347136066, -0.0057095694443998445], "lime_tokens": ["Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever.", "Seriously.", "If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life.", "No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights.", "After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy.", "Never have I been so angry at a main character.", "Ok, having said that, Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....", "and I'm talking graphic here, by the way.", "Pola X will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it."], "text": "Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever.

She remained cool - a sort of disingenuous lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film (I'm thinking the Jagger of Performance here) but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project.\n\nUltimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience. 4/10", "label": "neg", "url": "tt0167059"}, {"class": "neg", "logits": [0.7977565758073686, 0.2022434241926314], "class_probabilities": [0.7977565758073686, 0.2022434241926314], "lime_scores": [-0.02290362421781737, 0.040533235695951235, -0.011503211255754785, -0.11598344000517659, 0.005693367577317405, -0.03117382843213809, 0.03376719573736942, -0.14750722274986097, 0.0014984482601293134], "lime_tokens": ["This movie was shot using a digital camera, and it shows.", "There were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score.", "As if that weren't enough, the acting was also terrible.", "Now in Hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar, but here it was just BAD, especially by Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan)and Harvey, who (thank god) doesn't get to say much.", "After all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good, either.", "The jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward, and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next.", "The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines.", "All in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort.", "Thumbs down."], "text": "This movie was shot using a digital camera, and it shows.

Then take great plot lines from AD (son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. \n\nIf you watch this, I will have completely lost respect for you, as should your family. However, if you are a fan, you should love FOX's new comedy 'Til Death. Looks like real funny, cutting-edge stuff.
