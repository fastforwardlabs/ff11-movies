This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.\n\nThe characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.' Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. It won't be half as good on tape.\n\nThis movie is not for the easily freaked out. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be freaked out.....ENJOY!", "url": "tt0209958", "class_probabilities": [0.08374052494764328, 0.9162594079971313]}, {"logits": [0.8588111400604248, 0.6317542195320129], "probs": [0.5565216541290283, 0.44347837567329407], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.1847242327616443, -0.13331900926235604, 0.018068332251283323, 0.08721891089726982, -0.1887352452786919, -0.0691890208906387, 0.0023370366239377615, -0.08229704003055845], "lime_tokens": ["I do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.", "I just wanted to remark that I am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children.", "In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time.", "But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts.", "The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete).", "Later on DVD and Video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut (in Germany, there is already such a version around, running approx.", "110 minutes).", "It would be nice, if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavourable rating, so that I as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously, not only as a resource of money."], "text": "I do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.\n\nI just wanted to remark that I am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children.

One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat. They are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions, VCRs, etc. They then cross paths and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so they fight crime while they are on TV. Mitch hates the publicity while Trey loves it with his line, \"It's Showtime!\" Their TV antics and methods are shown on TV and they are the new \"Cops\" show. The fun begins.\n\nOverall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. However, it's rolls along as it treads and parodies reality TV shows. A good break from shows like Cops. Truly at the end, just a guilty pleasure.\n\nMy Rating: 7/10\n\nEliason A.", "url": "tt0284490", "class_probabilities": [0.09920121729373932, 0.9007987976074219]}, {"logits": [-2.2215545177459717, 0.7650367021560669], "probs": [0.04803531616926193, 0.9519646763801575], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.03438637333861597, 0.0, 0.03560590485811841, 0.02302749277881764, 0.015211328235765867, 0.013246936086605316, -0.027943882231962404, 0.0, 0.0, 0.024138195134813127, 0.0, 0.036224617866568, -0.011815904341404466, 0.0, 0.01382903774212499, 0.0, 0.0], "lime_tokens": ["Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team.", "While Rene Russo, William Shanter, and that guy from the Everyday video are alongside for the ride.", "This is a funny and a great movie.", "Not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.", "Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this hell of a movie.", "From start to finish, it was a masterpiece.", "No slapstick humor here.", "But good old time laughs.", "Making fun of all other cop flicks (to name a few Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Fifteen Minutes, and etc...)", "If you want to see a movie, see this one.", "You'll love it.", "It has a wonderful cast and crew.", "So, get off your a", "** from watching \"COPS\" and watch \"Showtime\" for a cop film.", "And remember, they'll be protrolling your neighbor at um...um...", "oh!", "At Friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says I'm a bad writer)."], "text": "Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team.

Then, today, I rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it. The speed that events were occurring was questionable, it could have been a little longer. I found it was very true to the book, however it left out some crucial parts: Mullet Finger's real name, etc. I felt as if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have really understand what was going on. The acting was quite good, another thing I had expected to be poor, however the cop, sorry I can't remember the actor's name, could have done a little better.

Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinaire, probably her best in her career. Her facial expressions in many scenes, were unbelievably true to character, and they were exploited to its best by Director Gutierrez. All actors and actresses were very good in their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. Her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character, so she actually enhances it in the movie.\n\nThe story, although sometimes over-intricate, is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end.

If you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don't. If I had my way, nobody would even have to read this summary.\n\nThe acting, despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic. The director was probaly a sadist. The witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.\n\nThe problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like \"Evil Dead 2\"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it's so bad it's funny. But it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.\n\nI could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but I think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it.

Day)"], "text": "Snakes on a Train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A Zombie curse is placed upon a woman, which causes her to have living snakes inside her. Brujo, who is looking after her, attempts to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several confrontations on the train, Brujo's collection of snakes manage to separate themselves from their owner and go on the hunt. Whilst all this is happening, normal, everyday passengers are relaxing, what is unknown to them is that something deadly is heading their way, and that their is no were out.\n\nAfter watching the wonderfully fun 'Snakes on a Plane', i had to check this out. I knew it was going to be a rip-off and that the film will look cheap, but what i found was worst to watch. The whole curse plot was silly and should never have been included. The special effects aren't terrible but are not the best looking. I did not have a clue about the ending. It was silly to watch and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible, and looked bad. They just could not act to save their lives. If you want a great laugh, watch this, otherwise you should really avoid this.\n\n\"We have a runaway train. I repeat.

Totally obsessed and it destroy's him. It's a total folly. The movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.\n\nThe supposed half sister is never convincing. Some very poor lighting effects. Music is interesting. But little else. It took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. I suppose if you like Being John Malkovich, you might like this. But where as BJM was a great movie that I just didn't want to watch again, Pola X is a movie I just hate to high hell. The only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (Hopefully yer not thinking of Catherine either.)\n\nThis movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. Not highly recommended. If if you like french movies.
