Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing.

I still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.\n\nBottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie.

Modern Love, despite my reservations (strange ending, a little too tangential)needed a short film that was commensurate with it's oddball strangeness, so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show.\n\nThe folks watching Modern Love really just didn't know what had hit them, - they were led up the path and this is not their fault.\n\nModern Love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film - a film that its maker seems to have 'wondered out loud' rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot.\n\nToo bad the audience was misinformed. Wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals.", "url": "tt0094142", "class_probabilities": [0.9516076445579529, 0.048392295837402344]}, {"logits": [-1.1164281368255615, 1.694791555404663], "probs": [0.05672089010477066, 0.9432791471481323], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.06370793622583242, 0.02145809690770189, 0.05737153449363638], "lime_tokens": ["Bedrooms and Hallways gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself, only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy.", "If you think that all gay comedies are the same, check this one out.", "Although the movie ends without much resolution, the hilarious one-liners, peculiar situations, and quirky characters are sure to satisfy."], "text": "Bedrooms and Hallways gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself, only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy.

Anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and I definitely suggest you check it out. \n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)", "url": "tt0087231", "class_probabilities": [0.020985262468457222, 0.9790146946907043]}, {"logits": [-2.711695671081543, 1.0505422353744507], "probs": [0.0227042306214571, 0.9772956967353821], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.01899127275371666, 0.007135860252388684, 0.012784792652196009, 0.01035516182764549, -0.01243173373996158, 0.01753759603847976, 0.01067491194852951, 0.0, 0.0, 0.005881768062999016, 0.007555058004185472, 0.02310605708994385], "lime_tokens": ["This was such a beautiful film.", "Such an amazing performance from Joseph and Brad.", "Very innocently written and performed.", "A must see !!", "I cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie.", "This is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch, it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of AIDS, how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them.", "Not only with AIDS, but with any terminal illness.", "I hadn't even heard of this movie until I scrolled through t.v.", "one day and happen to run across it.", "I recommend everyone to watch this, just don't forget your box of tissues.", "More movies should be made like this one.", "Extremely heartwarming."], "text": "This was such a beautiful film.

Central to the story is a fairly loveless couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All of the performances are stunning, and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully. Of course, its source material is James Joyce's short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, Tony Huston; stars his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thank you to Lions Gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for folks looking for a literate, subtle, yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a true gem.", "url": "tt0365513", "class_probabilities": [0.01600777357816696, 0.9839922785758972]}, {"logits": [-2.0705032348632812, 1.2791539430618286], "probs": [0.033906396478414536, 0.9660935997962952], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.012544071935572798, -0.00392416840276319, 0.001975043478557324, 0.009742466914666464, 0.007551832331863001, 0.009876694356522425, 0.002000695884976655, 0.01172299717646543, -0.0013049848477520159, 0.0013097193981660721], "lime_tokens": ["Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut.", "Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry.", "Sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film.", "Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather.", "Other great character actors play his card buddies.", "Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family.", "Faith, family, and marriage are respected.", "A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor.", "And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune--\"Return to Me.", "\"\n\nRecommended."], "text": "Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut.

In addition to Jim Brown in the lead part, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. How about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts we see none other than Judith M. Brown and last but definitely least the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil henchman.", "url": "tt0087365", "class_probabilities": [0.04784080386161804, 0.9521591663360596]}, {"logits": [0.4008846879005432, -0.5500395894050598], "probs": [0.7213010191917419, 0.27869898080825806], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [0.056096526131414075, -0.04834256185932765, -0.07282330620480383, 0.0, 0.0, -0.13592980710274058, 0.0, 0.0942035464242762, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.11556038896991598, 0.0500355324587422, 0.16887448310297343, -0.19559083022981322, 0.0, 0.11082654632431367], "lime_tokens": ["OK...i have seen just about everything....and some are considered classics that shouldn't be ( like all those Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven king", "junk)", ".......", "and some are considered just OK that are really great.....", "( like carnival of souls )........", "and then some are just plain ignored............like ( evil ed ) or ( pumpkin head and brain dead \"the bud Cort one\" )", "then some stick in your head once seen and never leave", "...........that's what this did to me........and for my money this is much better than last house on the left............", "last house was great till the ending...then it blew chunks.....what kind of dummy is gonna give a blow job to someone who just killed their kids ????", ".completely", "stupid ..go find the movie \"bully\" or even \"funny games\" if ya want realism and to be creep ed out.........", "but this damn thing stuck with me for years.........", "one cause chuck Connors always was scary.........", "two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever........", "three the chick being smothered in plaster still is one of the all time worst killings on film........and 4th the telekinetic powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected.......not to mention the dummies wax figures puppets etc", ".......it should be right there with psycho,last house,Texas chainsaw,etc.......", "it's a classic..............and deservedly so..........."], "text": "OK...i have seen just about everything....and some are considered classics that shouldn't be ( like all those Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven king junk).......and some are considered just OK that are really great.....( like carnival of souls )........and then some are just plain ignored............like ( evil ed ) or ( pumpkin head and brain dead \"the bud Cort one\" ) then some stick in your head once seen and never leave...........that's what this did to me........and for my money this is much better than last house on the left............last house was great till the ending...then it blew chunks.....what kind of dummy is gonna give a blow job to someone who just killed their kids ????.completely stupid ..go find the movie \"bully\" or even \"funny games\" if ya want realism and to be creep ed out.........but this damn thing stuck with me for years.........one cause chuck Connors always was scary.........two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever........three the chick being smothered in plaster still is one of the all time worst killings on film........and 4th the telekinetic powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected.......not to mention the dummies wax figures puppets etc.......it should be right there with psycho,last house,Texas chainsaw,etc....... it's a classic..............and deservedly so...........", "url": "tt0087365", "class_probabilities": [0.7213010191917419, 0.27869898080825806]}, {"logits": [2.760883331298828, -1.5577620267868042], "probs": [0.9868571162223816, 0.013142873533070087], "label": "pos", "lime_scores": [-0.03706120816732448, -0.005123155171784542, -0.062461157559900775, 0.004988036988754189, -0.01097811173699433, 0.007304298059818072, 0.01050435760486305, -0.0349903324943847, -0.028022574875823828, -0.07133703864588428], "lime_tokens": ["The problem with this series is that it is too real.", "I am watching it on Amazon \"Unbox\" and having just finished episode 2", "I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, the leader of the Cell.", "I cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact.", "Remember the old tag line for horror movies \"Just keep telling yourself its only a movie\"?", "Well I find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its \"only TV\".", "But of course it isn't only TV is it?", "The possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the United States is certainly within the range of plausibility.", "That's what gives this program its vicious authenticity.", "And that's why I hate it so much."], "text": "The problem with this series is that it is too real.

The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine, the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible.

Paul Wendkos' direction is lackluster and confusing. Performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3.\n\nDon't waste your time.

Mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it's utterly stupid of him to stray from her. The incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid.
