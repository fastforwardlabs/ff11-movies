Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing.

But that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude. It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is \"really\" happening, and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on. Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a \"tune in again next week\" climax. The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine, the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible.

Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust. However, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout.\n\nOur leads play their roles to perfection, playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour. There are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy. Some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it's worth giving it a chance to the end.\n\nIf you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late. Dark and engrossing, it will pull in a crowd. One I'd recommend you give a try.",label:"pos",url:"tt0762073"},{logits:[-2.6258544921875,2.9756321907043457],class_probabilities:[.003678786801174283,.9963212013244629],class:"pos",lime_scores:[.0034364157176336374,-.03574776287335048,.047669637951654784,.05640546310592989,-.014894846437121757,-.015110348793928625,.04889596506430691,.04484688140796761,.049268424069279664],lime_tokens:["After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Park's work, some of it is good","but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had.","This one does, it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.","The acting is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances.","Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.","The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichés.","The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen.","It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see.","This is just a great film."],text:"After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Park's work, some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had.

Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I\'ve seen in a long time.',label:"pos",url:"tt0120611"},{logits:[-2.4900548458099365,2.8974664211273193],class_probabilities:[.004552475176751614,.9954474568367004],class:"pos",lime_scores:[.013247713249884718,.018535739292333268,.023125470586105486,.04422516223966749,.02993008737444208,.03941105082739252,.007675899679096377],lime_tokens:["I absolutely LOVED this movie!","Since I don't want to give much away, it's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life","they have together.","It's very heartwarming story, between the struggles they have.","I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film!","This is definitely worth seeing!","Two thumbs up, way up!"],text:"I absolutely LOVED this movie!

Both of them have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z.(Cuddles)Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are characters like this today? Not one role could have been better cast. Bette Davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it. She would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play this lightly. She has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. Morgan is the essence of the nice guy. Because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. Just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones.

When being an American meant really\n\npicking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going. When\n\nthe world was such an untamed and unknown place. Well, this\n\nmovie has that...and more.

Have you ever seen a grown up scream I am not a loser before?\n\nI thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and in a cheesy Disney sort of way, it had a point to make. Something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once, I didn't care.\n\nIf you haven't watched it. Do so.

One forgets it is Frank up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed.\n\nKim Novak, eternally gorgeous and talented, does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider, always there for Frankie.\n\nSupporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are faultless.\n\nEleanor Parker, playing Frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept. She swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top. A forgettable performance.\n\nThe stagey, cheap settings are appalling, as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon. Almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness.\n\nThe music was irritating, poundingly so at times. As if each nuance of the script (example: when Louie is getting Frankie his fix out of a drawer) had to be underscored at a high decibel level.\n\n7 out of 10. Sinatra truly deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.",label:"pos",url:"tt0048347"},{logits:[-2.545008897781372,2.662280797958374],class_probabilities:[.0054466682486236095,.9945533275604248],class:"pos",lime_scores:[.10130836155281163,.025630569239355087,.009048797689335688,.039092063272381024,.06922542327384534,-.007908696377619134,.02519023570879962],lime_tokens:["A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict.","The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around)","a heroin addict really is.","Good movie, which will never truly be outdated.","Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE'S world can become.","Worth a look--an education of sorts.","The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in."],text:"A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict.

These three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today.',label:"pos",url:"tt0048347"},{logits:[-1.880300760269165,2.029494524002075],class_probabilities:[.019650714471936226,.9803493022918701],class:"pos",lime_scores:[.0881858702963332,.03062341683389892,.12132518911850014,-.014521584141590787,.1598132589873781,-.07010458693709871,.07236364542480414],lime_tokens:["This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s.","Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them.","Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite.","From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict","Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie!","With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.","Beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough."],text:"This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s.

There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. In place of a conventionally happy ending, there is a regrettably portentous finale about `Identity'  Xavier has become' all the friends he made. Nevertheless, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro-audience, who enjoyed themselves hugely and even applauded at the end.",label:"pos",url:"tt0283900"},{logits:[-2.0525338649749756,2.6683547496795654],class_probabilities:[.008828620426356792,.9911713004112244],class:"pos",lime_scores:[.041448517463007685,0,.04347466778530417,-.028923647656660643,0,.04300647190873057,.05942743338114087,.055784722537592896,0,0,.06254573791460974,-.04079871504270283,.05945829401255063,0,.24803081843081226],lime_tokens:["The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did).","I'm European and I've studied abroad","and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people.","The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off.","But, this film gets the stereotypes","so right","I cannot fault it.","Except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal.",'The English guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype.',"Drunk, annoying, insulting but shines through in the end.","As well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct.","At first he's shy, doesn't know anybody, misses home, doesn't know his way around.","As time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult.","A feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it.","I highly recommend this film."],text:"The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did).

Studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what's actually in the film -and yet there are some great things in it (great songs, great cinematography, etc.) . Should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of it's overall dreamlike feel. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change (thus the film's working title \"Changes\") and HEAD perfectly mirrors that time.",label:"pos",url:"tt0168077"},{logits:[-1.1632500886917114,1.8162636756896973],class_probabilities:[.048360008746385574,.9516400694847107],class:"pos",lime_scores:[-.005122156968174243,.04192794085663699,.03992637723746859,.017015431960777087,.03561760891369051,-.07548645957105136,.0704780569658078],lime_tokens:["This film starts as it ends and ends as it starts.","What is in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini stories, colour and lots more.","It looks at the world and our lives and tells The Monkees story from the view of the group members themselves.","It also looks at television and film and makes a visual commentary.","It shocks also, with scenes of war and shows how we are just pawns in a big game.","It says all this and much more, but if you don't look at it objectively you won't see much more than scenes strung together to join up the music.","It's the sort of film that can never get boring because it's so cleverly done."],text:"This film starts as it ends and ends as it starts.

This film is better than Unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means. ---IMDB Rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10",label:"pos",url:"tt0369053"},{logits:[-2.7691986560821533,2.5544190406799316],class_probabilities:[.004851432982832193,.9951485991477966],class:"pos",lime_scores:[-.03519284290503845,.11268044496937457,.25879847473439055,.21950547665008202],lime_tokens:["Those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else.","Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - though if we are fortunate only on their death.","This film is true in setting, atmosphere and dialogue to Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood'), and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of English upper class country life is very accurate).","I loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an UK-compatible DVD"],text:"Those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else.

For those of you that only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie flicks, well, open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the \"monsters\" in this are human, they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, see it!
