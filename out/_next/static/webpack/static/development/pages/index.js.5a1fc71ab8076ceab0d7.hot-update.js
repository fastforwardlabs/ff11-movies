This movie made me sad and angry.","label":"neg","url":"tt0349903"},{"class":"neg","logits":[0.6730882419160115,0.32691175808398854],"lime_scores":[0.013822363003641185,0.0,-0.024789485097908338,0.0,-0.030527008985797677,-0.013762491815850108,0.0,-0.020456695132940888,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.01815545433753496,0.0,0.0,-0.06978044432291326,-0.011249973599633747,0.0,-0.024542423411197677,0.0,0.01969893513312862],"lime_tokens":["Out of 15 people I loaned this movie too..","NO One finished it..","It was so Awfully.????????","Not good...","Just awful.","She sits in a chair the whole movie.","She's in a Closet.","The Chair she's sitting is nice.","I can't think of anything more to say.","But 10 lines of text.","To print this up.","My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie.,, because,,, he can give it to his friends,, and not have to worry about THOSE calling him back.","He's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years.","Which is how I got it..","Then..

Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time, when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)\n\nReally sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations","label":"neg","url":"tt0808151"},{"class":"neg","logits":[0.5196538573159948,0.4803461426840052],"lime_scores":[0.0,-0.009925772454754414,-0.002132887594880152,0.0,0.04159048104708788,-0.012734360761025866,-0.02033704535966351,-0.0064336944594951765,0.006863239184855267,-0.004719696827049844,-0.06330469330850483,0.0037081655739277693],"lime_tokens":["I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind.","I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book.","There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code.","I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book.","It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating.","Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level.","Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer.","They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work.","The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol.","In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about.","Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller.","4 out of 10"],"text":"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind.

A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.","label":"pos","url":"tt0446687"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.3831132563535482,0.6168867436464518],"lime_scores":[-0.014755648401852076,-0.005048885124648865,0.004299191628682951,0.01882909181271444,0.010492820799947488,0.0,0.005578119799146042,-0.002860875581690941,-0.005795209926922237,0.0,0.018485135781304247,0.02584344416618465],"lime_tokens":["I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live.","I waited patiently and it was worth the wait.","I totally fell in love with this movie.","The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.","The woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a great job playing the role.","I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it.","LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down.","(snickers)","I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch.","Rent this movie.","I do have to say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's doing movies outside of Harry Potter,even though I totally love him as Ron Weasley.","The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to broaden his skill!"],"text":"I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live.

Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.","label":"pos","url":"tt0037595"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.43847025734694167,0.5615297426530583],"lime_scores":[0.0,0.03964838556254827,-0.018815028192961113,0.00470074454347649,0.0,0.0035758283764839465,-0.000793830873432585,0.04158736132280075,0.008308031474355116,-0.056912294053001834,-0.017464234835727593,0.013465327309246983],"lime_tokens":["Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie.","The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). \"","Liz\" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut.","Of course, she's lying.","This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas.","In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party.","From there, things just go crazy.","Since the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling.","Plus, the characters are hilarious.","Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend Felix is always yelling 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong.","Finally, the movie ends the way a Christmas movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts \"What a Christmas!\"","In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie."],"text":"Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. \n\nThe movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). \"Liz\" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut.

My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place. Because this movie I believe was made with cheaper budget, the acting and quality were much higher.","label":"pos","url":"tt0913354"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.4590858969793742,0.5409141030206258],"lime_scores":[-0.028434243012195635,-0.017452621710268085,0.016195526528032946,-0.05674320431514129,-0.013867996305526521,0.018314028746788943,0.04374435932332672,0.018423494445812857,-0.004153282831065812,-0.0016827898990329853],"lime_tokens":["New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash.","The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly.","Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it.","First off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot.","It cranks everything up and just goes.","Next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat.","Lastly the film has a stellar cast that include Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne.","Its a first rate cast that sells and covers over the stories short comings.","This isn't brain surgery its a popcorn movie and on that level it scores highly.","Worth a look."],"text":"New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash.

An impressive debut by one of todays best directors.

Able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close-ups and Mahler score playing above him Not one for a Friday night with your girlfriend but certainly OK if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.","label":"pos","url":"tt0067445"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.44760779499206294,0.5523922050079371],"lime_scores":[0.0,0.007785930673502526,0.006163375637153445,-0.02050566772212758,0.031163603863647138,0.009358097344302945,-0.025664414757451983,0.005691051157581616,0.005127026638321574,0.0,0.006090270993629211,-0.018797294190947278,0.0],"lime_tokens":["A film to divide its viewers.","Just criticism points at its funereal pace, over-used snap zooms and persistent, lingering gazes between the protagonists.","Advocates point to Dirk Bogarde's mighty performance and Pasqualino De Santis' benchmark photography of Venice.","Taken altogether, this might suggest an indulgent, romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal).","In fact Visconti has succeeded in making a richer, more complex film than such a single-issue vehicle.","He has knit his ideas - foibles and all - into a meticulously paced arc.","Inside this does indeed sit the central performance of Bogarde's Aschenbach.","Rather than a simpering, Johnny-come-lately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in Tadzio.","His mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob","(and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback).","Mahler's music is possibly a little over-used although it is well appropriated.","The Italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much.","7/10"],"text":"A film to divide its viewers.

Also, Elizabeth Daily is a funny, existential character and the Prom King & Queen speech at the end is hilarious!","label":"pos","url":"tt0086525"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.4164134124369199,0.5835865875630801],"lime_scores":[-0.0013982506791106592,0.009588100884103562,0.027681299700952695,-0.010457296186655958,-0.010979357330883842,-1.4764332262643222e-05,0.007557726358171023,0.016078184306795182],"lime_tokens":["There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them.","Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight.","I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman.","Wishful thinking, I know.","Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.","It will take you back to a \"Totally Rad\" time which it seemed at the time, was a lot more simple.","Memo to studios:","Time to release the DVD!"],"text":"There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them.

I thought she wasn't the right person for this role,I just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.But as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. \n\nTo summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!","label":"pos","url":"tt0202470"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.4796888376854918,0.5203111623145081],"lime_scores":[-0.004074454936595539,0.006816006246116865,-0.015491247309086147,-0.02244777719263343,0.016321786588915282,-0.00783464059014372,0.0028717488640172934],"lime_tokens":["Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects.","Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.","Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming.","Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less.","Definitely worth checking out.","If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go.","Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while."],"text":"Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects.

Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.","label":"pos","url":"tt0171580"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.408848010565071,0.591151989434929],"lime_scores":[0.007290761238818333,0.00018669926454483233,-0.0150672097825668,0.0021838069132234022,0.07059623341233827,-5.075268903079697e-05,0.002281429552153197,-0.027862302396244255,0.015192451662902876,-0.014086818644612403],"lime_tokens":["After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air.","The film is like no other I have ever seen.","Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant","In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors).","Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.","Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial.","The trick to the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters.","While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite Dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty.","Nurse Betty is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence.","My Grade: 10/10."],"text":"After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air.

A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers. \n\nDirector Lieberman, who gave us such great B films as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller as well. The movie is nicely atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong suspense. This film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. The Oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by the crafty cinematography. The music score is a true original and awesome in contrast with the scenic visuals. \n\nDeborah Benson makes for a great lead, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon provides some occasional charisma. The supporting cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also does quite well. \n\nA true gem of the slasher genre, that needs no gore to thrill. Definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike. See it!\n\n*** 1/2 out of ****","label":"pos","url":"tt0082592"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.2854118750430607,0.7145881249569392],"lime_scores":[0.01878222502017556,0.010761279593069347,0.01513553179972468,0.05313805221356508,0.015822491167216186,0.03576682096936985,-0.01650382512089863,1.1934765139832992e-05,0.012672659574932695],"lime_tokens":["What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek","I adore my country","and I liked the flattering director's point of view.","Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship.","An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make.","Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.","I adored Christian Bale playing Mandras the heroine's husband-to-be, he looks very very good as a Greek, his personality matched the one of the Greek patriot!","A true fighter in there, or what!","One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection...for ever!"],"text":"What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view.

Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just juices it up. This is great stuff.","label":"pos","url":"tt0089003"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.4770948111778928,0.5229051888221072],"lime_scores":[0.007138576540250781,0.017325856803964708,-0.021829445378909056,-0.040009218904226894,-0.006388150763458916,0.013870585825685977,-0.0071876141596353025,-0.0009289795867687623,0.015439744939134385],"lime_tokens":["The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film .","If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a \" Conchie \" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution .","Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time .","But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes .","Yeah","I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens .","Who needs Mayor Rudy when you`ve got Paul Kersey , an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps .","Paul Kersey","I salute you sir"],"text":"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film .

The movie is set in the 1930's. So along the way, they encounter a number of funny and interesting charatcers. All have a different story or achievement they are striving for. Really the majority of the movie may seem random. Some may say it was pointless and boring, but if you look for the smart comedy (and occasionally stupid) that is integrated into the movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one.\n\nI liked the performances given by George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson. All of them did very well in their roles, an they worked great together. But to finish this off, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" is a smart, funny, and a movie adventure that I wouldn't let pass up.","label":"pos","url":"tt0215002"},{"class":"pos","logits":[0.32965100500742345,0.6703489949925765],"lime_scores":[0.000792500020302755,0.01133853766857338,0.01689145883125521,0.015754502445673908,0.010513975923021597,0.035995493485847296,-0.004044158634925866],"lime_tokens":["I thought this movie was great!","I saw this when it came out in the theaters so I do not remember all the details.","I remember it being based on Homer's tale on Odysseus.","Names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale.","I found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it.","I really enjoyed this version of modernized old tales much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes.","I will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors."],"text":"I thought this movie was great!
