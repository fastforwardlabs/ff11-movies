I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects\x85 or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.","label":"neg","url":"tt0808151"},{"logits":[1.7180705070495605,-1.8753198385238647],"class_probabilities":[0.9732313752174377,0.026768647134304047],"class":"neg","lime_scores":[-0.04722892189192446,0.13953468108323067,-0.09266882700298469,-0.0824994043567276,-0.06716251106790588,-0.13319328603135197,0.09956095325742269,0.022777425404846712,-0.14225553919937983],"lime_tokens":["Ron Howard and his \"editors\" only had one job to do...","Follow the guidelines of the book which was \"rich\", \"mysterious\", \"moving\" and highly cinematic in its approach!","What they did?","They changed EVERYTHING","and I mean EVERYTHING!","What is left is something that has no right being called \"Angels & Daemons\"!","I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!","I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for \"this\" film.","I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless......."],"text":"Ron Howard and his \"editors\" only had one job to do...

Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.\n\nIt's sad, too, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I just can't believe movies this bad are still being made. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.","label":"neg","url":"tt0384312"},{"logits":[2.5067238807678223,-2.6689071655273438],"class_probabilities":[0.9943791031837463,0.005620875861495733],"class":"neg","lime_scores":[0.037922381314829265,0.05284689625310944,0.09618329664202849,-0.06540421251077772,-0.08045386102585927,0.06041960000825279,-0.1942184065128785,-0.06201121630806612,-0.07408785221994611,-0.13161551384604717,0.0],"lime_tokens":["I'm 35.","Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead, and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2.","It was cool also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent.","But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for Bruce's early fans.","Either I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm just not part of Bruce's target audience anymore.","I'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film.","But this over extended matin\xE9e sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor.","Campbell better talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last Evil Dead reunion picture to get back my interest.","At least there would be a good director behind the camera...","Sorry Bruce, this just doesn't cut it for me.","Take care."],"text":"I'm 35.

Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film. If that's your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want. Had I been alone, I would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition. This thing is like a moron's guide to crap film-making: In bred Southern git, stupid but attractive leads, knives a plenty, gore a plenty, stock menacing truck, I could go on. After watching this film, I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought that film sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.","label":"neg","url":"tt0397065"},{"logits":[-0.11676938831806183,0.708879292011261],"class_probabilities":[0.3045659363269806,0.695434033870697],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.07678790543175039,-0.09396240866590493,0.14228323940604326,-0.11309301742494388,-0.0854451853839577,0.141132457849443,-0.07201164033429132],"lime_tokens":["A quick, funny coming-of-age matin\xE9e romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all.","It functions, in effect, as a vehicle for Justin Long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac ads, Dodgeball and The Break Up.","He's funny, earnest and young - a big career ahead.","A town's worth of college wannabes find a fake website Bartelby (Long) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the 'college' like it were a short notice Facebook party.","Lewis Black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in Dean - Long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution).","Well executed, feelgood and instantly forgettable.","4/10"],"text":"A quick, funny coming-of-age matin\xE9e romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all.

She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. \n\nBut the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.\n\nSeems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is anyway no respect and expectations, might as well taste sin.","label":"pos","url":"tt0184474"},{"logits":[-0.29834437370300293,0.5835866928100586],"class_probabilities":[0.29277777671813965,0.7072222828865051],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.044661721847393976,-0.04712111125578524,0.6405021123703708,-0.22117822791165073],"lime_tokens":["It is more a subtle story of the fact that in Indian household how most decisions are taken by the man, how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady, for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires, not to give the woman pleasure.","And in such a type of scenario, women invariably have two choices, either to accept all this and take it into their own life, which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves, which makes a movie!","Fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option, which women choose for themselves, no sacrifice, not to serve anybody else, rather a decision for their own good.","Somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn't find an acceptance in the Indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression, then the whole debate doesn't even arise."],"text":"It is more a subtle story of the fact that in Indian household how most decisions are taken by the man, how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady, for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires, not to give the woman pleasure.

Overall, I was disappointed with the subdued narrative, and I felt it ran a little too long.\n\nBut I still recommend this film, for its vision, its visual flourish, its dark humor, and at the end of the day, it is an interesting film even if imperfect. 9/10","label":"pos","url":"tt0762073"},{"logits":[-2.6015970706939697,2.737818479537964],"class_probabilities":[0.004775757435709238,0.9952242374420166],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.009025554161542998,0.0,0.01700777441493648,-0.006804673961315588,0.011592088516942848,0.0,-0.01110725280605954,0.016483274302338088,0.0,0.011615216903806028,0.0,0.016414968528673482,-0.0063218505021074775,0.016708949287827336],"lime_tokens":["If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect.","His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor.","THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama.","The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around.","Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.","The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR.","VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing.","Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold, consistently surprising filmmaker.","It's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant.","This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR.","VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical.","But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, thought-provoking, and rewarding.","If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, seeing THIRST should be obvious.","Easily one of the best films of 2009."],"text":"If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect.

I know that it was on the 'Video Nasties' list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it, Alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED!!!.","label":"pos","url":"tt0069994"},{"logits":[-1.7227202653884888,2.0380258560180664],"class_probabilities":[0.02273735962808132,0.977262556552887],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.025141865806792157,-0.03843275661273928,0.05027861737539439,0.11891809378748514,0.21547944707525377,-0.0238075359374103,0.04100844960850763,0.06933214756055779,-0.01527052612843537,0.0,0.16713422186529805],"lime_tokens":["Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there.","She is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor.","Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be?","DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me.","The acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac.","The chills just jump right off the screen.","You probably won't have to say \"It's only a movie, it's only a movie\", it isn't that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which I do.","It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed.","AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon.","Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience.","But I think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish."],"text":"Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there.

Hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face/ keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!!","label":"pos","url":"tt0037595"},{"logits":[-2.2845358848571777,2.697040557861328],"class_probabilities":[0.00681645143777132,0.9931835532188416],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.0,0.13598002888562222,-0.05750387631178938,0.04025992634739925,-0.04350385154974139,0.04245831877302009,0.10710853539255602,0.0,-0.053189140928740206,-0.07731812881904208,0.059413784975265026,0.1553820543060404],"lime_tokens":["I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise.","A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s.","The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine.","At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about.","The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook.","To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner,who has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix.","There's a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman.","Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters.","The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan.","He starts well but as the movie goes on, becomes really a bore.","One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part.","Anyway, this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays...in Connecticut."],"text":"I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise.

There is some nice photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. A great film to see with EVERY member of your family.","label":"pos","url":"tt0219854"},{"logits":[-0.8321876525878906,1.196434497833252],"class_probabilities":[0.11623038351535797,0.8837696313858032],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.022131978138269462,0.06253045468201182,-0.008701632453505113,-0.06159490725059411,-0.020726400069075262,0.0799187392913921,0.023541125988675637,0.1062181497894837,-0.05889406235243536,0.6323324669243403],"lime_tokens":["As a word of explanation, Disney's \"The Kid\" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name.","What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide.","Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an \"Image Consultant\".","He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well.","You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits.","Into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere).","This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest.","Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant.","Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter-action between the Willis and Breslin characters.","\"The Kid\", though not the greatest of Disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling."],"text":"As a word of explanation, Disney's \"The Kid\" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name.

It's cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than Ocean's eleven.","label":"pos","url":"tt0349903"},{"logits":[-0.6990596055984497,1.2061015367507935],"class_probabilities":[0.12952543795108795,0.8704745173454285],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.0031483496733476883,-0.0069093924615708634,0.03368500249961776,-0.04282309192206409,0.008427612925768747,-0.009201079775825398,-0.03791287078646142,0.061412523653393405,0.6058226647700735],"lime_tokens":["With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing.","Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels.","Would it sustain the feeling of the first film?","Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11?","We'll never know, because they didn't try.","At least, not in the way I expected.","Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre.","If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.","If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and an absolutely genius scene where Julia Roberts has to impersonate herself, then you'll love Ocean's 12."],"text":"With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing.

Also, Elizabeth Daily is a funny, existential character and the Prom King & Queen speech at the end is hilarious!","label":"pos","url":"tt0086525"},{"logits":[-0.148675337433815,0.627956211566925],"class_probabilities":[0.3150463402271271,0.6849536895751953],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.09735813775388177,-0.11839613474742684,0.3717931121883313,-0.036364062516141146,-0.007284809062557462,-0.03934214686245515,0.0226398870174169,0.14646726365926832],"lime_tokens":["There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them.","Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight.","I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman.","Wishful thinking, I know.","Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.","It will take you back to a \"Totally Rad\" time which it seemed at the time, was a lot more simple.","Memo to studios:","Time to release the DVD!"],"text":"There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them.

Whenever I hear \"Melt With You\" I am taken back to the finale of this movie. \n\nWhat ever happened to his cute costar, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Certainly took a different turn than Nicolas! Interestingly, the slutty friend (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being the voice of Tommy from the Rugrats (she is billed as E.G. Daily for that horrid show)! Bizarre!\n\nIF you want to take a great trip back to the 80's, watch this movie. It is definitely a classic.

Finally, SNE really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before & granted, SNE is no \"Pyscho\" or \"TCM 74\" but it certainly merits a look imo. \n\nBloodStone's Recommendation: Take in a matin\xE9e showing of \"See No Evil\" Bloodstone's Rating: 7.5/10","label":"pos","url":"tt0437179"},{"logits":[-0.15663659572601318,0.7213588953018188],"class_probabilities":[0.29359331727027893,0.7064066529273987],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.05480492135069433,0.16667604251352855,-0.03630257650079527,0.010808778299850495,-0.2833667509281614,0.39996254644378554,-0.033682569926476794],"lime_tokens":["A dangerous psychopathic killer Jacob Goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded Jacob four years ago.","When one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives...","\"See","No Evil\" was directed by the porno filmmaker Gregory Dark and it stars WWE superstar Kane as remorseless psychopath.","The supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.","Overall,I liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.","Sure,it's clich\xE9,but who cares.7 out of 10."],"text":"A dangerous psychopathic killer Jacob Goodnight is holed up in the abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel,alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for community service duty along with the cop who wounded Jacob four years ago.When one of their own is kidnapped by the killer and her fate uncertain,the remaining petty criminals must fight for their lives...\"See No Evil\" was directed by the porno filmmaker Gregory Dark and it stars WWE superstar Kane as remorseless psychopath.The supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here,but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.Overall,I liked this film and you should too,if you are into mindless slasher flicks.Sure,it's clich\xE9,but who cares.7 out of 10.","label":"pos","url":"tt0437179"},{"logits":[1.4594770669937134,-1.3937268257141113],"class_probabilities":[0.9454841017723083,0.05451594665646553],"class":"neg","lime_scores":[0.0581023267040855,-0.049640212957894767,-0.05481208797285136,0.0,-0.18234284098953396,0.11829745462438797,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.15609873000917027,0.05311879141891864,0.0,-0.10772296088818048,0.0,0.0,0.1313265420941637,0.07304632058444904],"lime_tokens":["So the WWE has done it.","They have poured over into film;their first one being See No Evil, starring their very own Kane.","I caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film...","It just seemed to clich\xE9 and looked like nothing new.","To my surprise it actually wasn't half bad.","A viewer stated above that it is good B-horror movie fun, and honestly thats the best way to describe it.","Now the question I was asking myself was how was Kane going to hold up...","Well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'Jacob Goodnight' character.","He sold the role really well, and really did look menacing.","But what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle.","The acting was decent, and the story was nothing new of course, but we all know that.","The directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done.","Considering this was directed by a porn movie director, I was quite surprised.","I'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun.","Think of this movie as a modern day latter Friday the 13th film.","And save room for the ending too, cuz it's a good one.","And stick around after the credits too..."],"text":"So the WWE has done it.

Overall, I say this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.","label":"pos","url":"tt0209958"},{"logits":[-2.686413049697876,2.340235471725464],"class_probabilities":[0.0065179988741874695,0.9934819340705872],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.082055425482427,0.0,-0.019696285736685283,0.06824200973361108,0.015428712487805755,0.02917318202818297,0.0,0.04131293197323182,0.0,0.03733802276017474,0.03934896878881956,0.0,0.04313908278054219,0.057872854139792144],"lime_tokens":["The Cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well.","but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever.","the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.","the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come.","this movie is a perfect case for the \"suspension of disbelief\" theory.","forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images.","and J.Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work.","the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & the costumes just stunning.","the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art.","its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid.","one of the most refreshing movies of this decade.","The Cell is a must watch.","A bold new step in movie making.","an enthralling 8!!"],"text":"The Cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well. but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.\n\nthe images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come. this movie is a perfect case for the \"suspension of disbelief\" theory. forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images. and J.Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & the costumes just stunning. \n\nthe movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade.

What really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.","label":"pos","url":"tt0238784"},{"logits":[-2.3265256881713867,2.5344901084899902],"class_probabilities":[0.00768312718719244,0.9923168420791626],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.010102862602500005,-0.0007098452656202988,0.0,0.0073423725895620795,0.0,0.009419640637631323,-0.0010048141316975798,-0.0016721214933229777,0.010794357195073042,0.001959737596723576,0.0,0.008845359560068615,0.005003843946877981],"lime_tokens":["This show is really great.","It's smart.","It's funny.","It's great acting and writing.","This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen.","The Dialogues are really funny and well acted.","Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.","You really do believe they are mother and daughter.","This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.","Just watch this show","I highly recommend it.","It's great and definitely the best show on the air.","Season 7 stars Tuesday September 26th, 2006, 8/7c on the new The CW"],"text":"This show is really great.

But, still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, i promise you, you will be staisfied!","label":"pos","url":"tt0082592"},{"logits":[-2.273416519165039,2.000865936279297],"class_probabilities":[0.01373087428510189,0.9862691760063171],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.0,0.0,0.08570894800156593,0.1229765864323857,0.04188549516378442,0.0,0.0,-0.032199795950681155,0.0,0.046096310306471676,0.0,0.0,-0.01080074194007465,0.0,0.07201279741264184,0.05222632088951922,0.0,-0.04914173204443914,0.021988649846630348],"lime_tokens":["Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film.","The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman.","Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick.","The cinematography is gorgeous.","The acting is top notch.","The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.","Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind.","Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.","There's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.","Just Before Dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get.","The killer(s) are very menacing -","Almost like it's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory.","The end scene is a bit off kilter.","For the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking.","I'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher.","Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it.","The setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy.","The death sequences aren't particularly gory, but I'm not sure the film needed gore.","See it!"],"text":"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film.

She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings. Aside from the love story angle I thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people...government makes the decision whereas the people suffer. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake. They were survivors.","label":"pos","url":"tt0238112"},{"logits":[-1.8942090272903442,2.218705415725708],"class_probabilities":[0.016096679493784904,0.9839032888412476],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.019731980412986287,0.0,0.0767225072924895,0.06889441303618721,-0.02431875019992597,0.05068393245611666,0.016851361742501448,0.0390705273413131,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.04558731204145775,0.03061059539752971,0.045740745908304604],"lime_tokens":["i did not read the book.","nor do i care to.","the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it.","no, it was not a \"10\" film, but it was enjoyable.","women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself.","hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on \"in love\" and \"loving.\"","also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny.","i enjoyed watching the developing romance.","also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium.","this is a \"10\" sci fi movie.","do see this film.","ignore the previous user's comments.","one -- especially the ladies!!","also do visit my website at my name as one word and a \"dot\" com."],"text":"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a \"10\" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on \"in love\" and \"loving.\"\n\nalso, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. \n\nalso, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium. this is a \"10\" sci fi movie.\n\ndo see this film. ignore the previous user's comments. \n\none -- especially the ladies!! also do visit my website at my name as one word and a \"dot\" com.","label":"pos","url":"tt0238112"},{"logits":[-2.6320226192474365,2.726562023162842],"class_probabilities":[0.004685507621616125,0.9953144788742065],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.08643701097325703,0.08045638884943004,0.02297510315616169,0.042725189915258456,0.024457289564339874],"lime_tokens":["Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful Nicolas Cage, who as always is brilliant in the movie.","The music in the film is really nice too.","I'd advise anyone to go and see it.","Brilliant!","10/10"],"text":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful Nicolas Cage, who as always is brilliant in the movie.

If you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time.\n\nNoah","label":"pos","url":"tt0397065"},{"logits":[-1.4753767251968384,1.9990620613098145],"class_probabilities":[0.030048342421650887,0.9699516296386719],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.03736381661677161,-0.050754371476593396,-0.02909712121845651,0.05730207011629044,0.19752125388148536,0.09330891425451286,0.3496032648163241],"lime_tokens":["A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie.","The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen.","The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision.","For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence, this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video, because at the screening I was at, we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a \"woman of questionable values\".","The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts which make that average person cringe...","this movie hit all the bases.","It is definitely worth a watch."],"text":"A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie.

When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case.\n\nAs if this isn't enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to care for him.\n\nThe acting is quite good here despite the never-ending \"Peyton Place\" like theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife.\n\nThe film is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. O well, the marriage ended anyway.","label":"pos","url":"tt0369053"},{"logits":[-1.97404146194458,1.9086062908172607],"class_probabilities":[0.02018057554960251,0.9798193573951721],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[0.07400314633524317,0.0433522818732081,-0.05066670485680963,-0.017225323103394544,-0.0317851844540238,0.08833482475932049,0.0,0.0,0.39579777084816137,-0.06353390871682062,0.028348317202062313,0.11151144309930702],"lime_tokens":["Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels?","Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England.","So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven.","And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication.","And so the web of \"separate lies\" begins to fail and then hold together again.","And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives.","How many webs of deceit are to be displayed in this growing tapestry?","The impulse is to prop up sterling reputations and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world.","Wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and decorum, and yet humanity, of those who have much to hide.","Those who desire clarity and openness on the way to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so much deception.","And yet, who among us, has not something similar to hide about his loved ones?","Nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this web is fated to crumble some day."],"text":"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels?

The finale is genuine and original.\n\nAfter seeing \"Don't Torture a Duckling\" you really have to wonder how Fulci's later stuff got so off beat. I like all his stuff, but he strayed. Maybe he figured he already did it...Because with this film, he hits the bullseye.\n\nI'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento owns the giallo genre. Fulci beats him with this one. \n\n10 out of 10, kids.","label":"pos","url":"tt0069019"},{"logits":[-0.5176913738250732,0.7154472470283508],"class_probabilities":[0.22563259303569794,0.7743674516677856],"class":"pos","lime_scores":[-0.06484506157028976,0.002692692401200441,0.10811001914489139,0.05028807864857012,0.5011271997271572,-0.059808114629755396,0.09802371914348254,-0.0010194360230391323,-0.26200266186392407],"lime_tokens":["What a surprise this film was.","I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director.","He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line.","The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.","The photography in this film is fantastic.","A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.","A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence.","What went wrong Lucio?","Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that."],"text":"What a surprise this film was.

     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
     * `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `conforms`, `constant`, `countBy`, `create`,

     * `difference`, `differenceBy`, `differenceWith`, `drop`, `dropRight`,
