Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0397065"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.16877914269563832, 0.8312208573043617], "class_probabilities": [0.16877914269563832, 0.8312208573043617], "lime_scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.033707249500269716, 0.02417342967467899, 0.022876430210579182, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04247857141332604, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04037713313349053, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03104688245568105, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.022586469656244657, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05535818627761009, 0.02293038970538429, 0.035899262834939535], "lime_tokens": ["I'm not the biggest fan of westerns.", "My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone.", "This movie though, I loved!", "It was great!", "The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie.", "Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent!", "I even think it beat out both movies in someway.", "Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run.", "I do think it beat out Tombstone though.", "Both had there strong points.", "For instance, they both had excellent well known casts, very good plots, and very good filming.", "But Posse beat out Tombstone in four ways in my opinion.", "First, the characters were more unique in Posse.", "The music was better in Posse.", "The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp.", "And the biggest difference, the action sequences!", "Oh my gosh!", "Posse was a western with really good action sequences.", "I mean really good!", "The action was fast paced.", "Like modern day based shoot'em up movies.", "The action had big budget explosions too!", "The fistfights were pretty good also.", "Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie!", "I suggest buying this excellent movie!"], "text": "I'm not the biggest fan of westerns.

He uses sienna and gray-scale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s.\n\nPerez also gives life to the film by using time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing.\n\nI feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how migrant farmworkers live, what they do for entertainment, and their beliefs.", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0398883"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.26292098896546057, 0.7370790110345394], "class_probabilities": [0.26292098896546057, 0.7370790110345394], "lime_scores": [0.03666431222223738, -0.00785337991709183, 0.042003207162715085, 0.006730210618633306, 0.06857715332979711, 0.02488440382643945, 0.0357306571362001, 0.04234127646209823, 0.027506306069734244, 0.002674045901386803], "lime_tokens": ["Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys were creating history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on.", "I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels.", "It is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life.", "But I never forgot.", "It's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where I live.", "I cannot watch this film enough.", "Every time I view it, some other aspect rises to the top, some other viewpoint come into sharp focus.", "The vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intermeshed with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not over-done narrative, all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of American history.", "In the words of Glen Friedman - \"It was F-ing unbelievable.", "\""], "text": "Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys were creating history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on.

This is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man.'\n\nRobert Stack- WE LOVE YOU!!!

Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man\n\nThis movie is a classic, superb acting, well written, a real love story set in Chicago, what more can you ask for?\n\nSuperB Black Love Story\n\nAmsterdam, Holland", "label": "pos", "url": "tt0087365"}, {"class": "neg", "logits": [0.5675886316282239, 0.4324113683717761], "class_probabilities": [0.5675886316282239, 0.4324113683717761], "lime_scores": [0.057122374698338814, -0.04489766349149381, 0.02267509574318999, -0.01726022335003118, 0.005327850029797989, -0.05751320813147225, 0.04124025523873373, -0.08181545993327466, 0.0, 0.016638369955752307, 0.03320568149583278], "lime_tokens": ["I was kinda surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case.", "I certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one.", "I think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old.", "Plot:", "A girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd.'", "They talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum (that reminded me of Phantasm...) and they proceed to torment her in the night.", "Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them!", "It sounds awfully cheesy, but given the age and the budget, which was no doubt pretty small, this film is fun on many levels.", "Watch for an early EG Daily as one of the in crowd brats.", "I enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend.", "7 out of 10, kids."], "text": "I was kinda surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case.

They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene. The scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on. She says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. She then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. The other three in the gang (excluding Rod) run into the store.

Most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Encurralados\" (\"Trapped\")", "label": "neg", "url": "tt0091649"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.3995919848240515, 0.6004080151759484], "class_probabilities": [0.3995919848240515, 0.6004080151759484], "lime_scores": [-0.00645530168556917, 0.013560492445727892, 0.20982766762365548, -0.005236081786353904, -0.06856026847989927], "lime_tokens": ["Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end.", "That's odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen", "and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage.", "I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell.", "Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, I'd say we have a bad movie on our hands...."], "text": "Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end.

To be honest I saw his picture on the DVD cover but didn't notice that he got top billing. A sticker was strategically placed over his name! It was watchable and I quite liked the Dickens story alongside present day. Maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better.

The worst thing from \"Harlem nights\" are both the scenario and its terrible decors. Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch \"Harlem Nights\" that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name Murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.", "label": "neg", "url": "tt0858437"}, {"class": "neg", "logits": [0.5757855840461151, 0.4242144159538849], "class_probabilities": [0.5757855840461151, 0.4242144159538849], "lime_scores": [-0.036519394524902785, 0.010899619384078666, -0.0367434353526835, 0.03569337733082966], "lime_tokens": ["This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script, which was mostly used up in the beginning.", "After that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through.", "The movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded.", "It's not recommended."], "text": "This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script, which was mostly used up in the beginning.

The ending is just bad.\n\nIn summary, whenever you have a chance to see this, don't - there WILL be something better on.\n\nR-T-C \"True horror films don't have a PG rating\"", "label": "neg", "url": "tt0238546"}, {"class": "pos", "logits": [0.2721184686633899, 0.7278815313366102], "class_probabilities": [0.2721184686633899, 0.7278815313366102], "lime_scores": [0.016312794218719943, -0.00017498385978771428, 0.11879671247121679, -0.0309067874100949, 0.08283151718408081, 0.06368310744264889], "lime_tokens": ["Norman Wisdom's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings \u0096 bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date,", "this being a product of the Swinging Sixties!", "The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of her fickle character.", "The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have it and, if anything, is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979]", "\u0096 both of which, incidentally, I've only just watched); towards the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking!", "The Pretty Things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy title track!"], "text": "Norman Wisdom's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings \u0096 bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date, this being a product of the Swinging Sixties!
