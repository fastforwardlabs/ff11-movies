However, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0349903\"}, {\"logits\": [2.3576600551605225, -2.331237316131592], \"class_probabilities\": [0.990886926651001, 0.009113011881709099], \"class\": \"neg\", \"lime_scores\": [0.0035551346637242697, 0.0022463427134851665, -0.00363552343962345, -0.0026410818337766137, 0.003952295087747372, -0.0039216384198226895, -0.0031391897624087903, 0.0, -0.00557134198551607, -0.0034966681651508948, -0.0019887277482393793, 0.0], \"lime_tokens\": [\"What can I say about Ocean's Twelve?\", \"Who thought that it would ever come to this?\", \"A gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace.\", \"I found myself amazed at how bad this really was.\", \"Really!\", \"I have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable.\", \"I'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel.\", \"What was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back?\", \"The movie is just boring and so drag along that I can't ever sit through this.\", \"It really is bad.\", \"Just stay as far, repeat, far away as possible from this movie.\", \"It's worthless.\"], \"text\": \"What can I say about Ocean's Twelve?

This movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. First off, Ted Raimi was annoying, just flat out annoying. There was nothing to his badly acted / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. The directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots...yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell did not deliver.\\n\\nI did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall', but still I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got much less. By the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me, no dialogue that resonated within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0384312\"}, {\"logits\": [1.9308632612228394, -1.9808921813964844], \"class_probabilities\": [0.9803870320320129, 0.019612984731793404], \"class\": \"neg\", \"lime_scores\": [0.0, 0.03380145768420554, 0.02877230800768802, 0.060709512170213434, 0.07562281117687196, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04954413174566951, -0.026526251175728422, 0.0, 0.07505442779159689, -0.046865062759721014, 0.06488038796947802, -0.41898048700886137], \"lime_tokens\": [\"Guys, what can I tell you?\", \"I'm Bulgarian.\", \"I can't remember how many times I talk to Americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is Bulgaria, but they say things like: \\\"There's a war going on there, right?\\\" or \\\"I've never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet\\\" Go watch Bruce Campbell's \\\"The Man With The Screaming Brain\\\".\", \"I was curious about this movie, cause 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - \\\"Evil Dead\\\" trilogy\", \"and \\\"The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.\\\" 2)\", \"The movie was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, the second after \\\"Alien Apocalypse\\\" which is also nearly unwatchable.\", \"3) I enjoy nice B-movies\", \"Well...\", \"The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they raid your car, wave around illegal guns, and you can get killed any moment.\", \"And Bruce's line \\\"Bull$h1t Bulgaria\\\" is more than offending.\", \"Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team, Bruce does his special - beats himself up and that's all.\", \"Nothing more to see here.\", \"Peoeple give this movie 10 just because of Bruce's cult status, but it doesn't deserve more than 3.\", \"Waste of film.\"], \"text\": \"Guys, what can I tell you?

If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. Then you have a bit time to have fun. But its not any luxury or dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. The ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yeah, what a moral.

Looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more, that show an eye for these details, that makes the BBC series so worthwhile. Sorry, looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations.\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0091649\"}, {\"logits\": [1.6260323524475098, -2.3676681518554688], \"class_probabilities\": [0.9819021224975586, 0.018097814172506332], \"class\": \"neg\", \"lime_scores\": [-0.0025962814385124605, -0.0025100838760469817, 0.0018746929379958297, 0.0011568894433540858, -0.00223011102073206, 0.0, -0.0010483905747465485, -0.001730887109791686, -0.002633429322681497, -0.0007765249602345912, -0.0013067085398701303], \"lime_tokens\": [\"What an awful adaptation.\", \"The worst part was the music.\", \"Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's??\", \"????\", \"The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy.\", \"I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually.\", \"I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library.\", \"They should have paid me to take it.\", \"I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another.\", \"Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the \\\"bad guys\\\" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't.\", \"This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.\"], \"text\": \"What an awful adaptation.

Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyways, back on subject, the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it.

No matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual matter, or outrageous behaviour you put in a film, if the STORY is not good, then the film is not good. The film credits show clips of all the actors, including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back, which is a great ending to this film.

Also, if you watch 'Don't' first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg's other films. In summary they really don't come any more esoteric than this - well, actually they do, track down Brownrigg's 'Keep My Grave Open'. Mad genius.

Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better. The whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they're doing without laying on gratuitous hamming, except where it's called for, as with Julie Andrews' bits or Jonathan Pryce's camp videos. If you're not open-minded you won't get it. (See Mark Adnum's bizarre review, which he devotes to adulation of Stephanie Beacham, her career and her brother's OBE for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives.) Taking that as a cue, I might as well spend time eulogizing Amo Gulinello's stellar cameo as a TV station intern or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. So, cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time.

She is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called \\\"Showtime\\\" starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the funny part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or 8.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0284490\"}, {\"logits\": [-0.10524548590183258, 0.38920387625694275], \"class_probabilities\": [0.3788459897041321, 0.6211540102958679], \"class\": \"pos\", \"lime_scores\": [0.04814399859153774, 0.34089590053200924, -0.08253709576730352, -0.041594990903312534, 0.03375404269132927, 0.3270775698746022], \"lime_tokens\": [\"Contains Spoiler\", \"The movie is a good action/comedy\", \"but i don't know if the director cut too many parts\", \"but it seems that the bad guy die too fast.\", \"The end of the movie come, the bad guy dies and that's it.\", \"The special effects are good and i don't regret paying to see it at the theatre.\"], \"text\": \"Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action/comedy but i don't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast.

I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he is an Ingrid Bergman fan but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so great about her? Perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. It's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are utterly boring in comparison.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0070337\"}, {\"logits\": [-2.641794204711914, 2.575692892074585], \"class_probabilities\": [0.005391704849898815, 0.9946082830429077], \"class\": \"pos\", \"lime_scores\": [-0.012661110432463875, -0.007019744827431749, 0.033301758964538505, 0.015441545247393263, 0.06268686105271963, 0.0079837440979978, 0.0253292065300523, 0.055581183834273996], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This version of \\\"The Lost Horizon\\\" is actually not a bad film at all.\", \"I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s.\", \"I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially.\", \"(Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.)\", \"The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent.\", \"Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all.\", \"I have this film on video and watch it every so often...\", \"and I enjoy it each and every time!\"], \"text\": \"This version of \\\"The Lost Horizon\\\" is actually not a bad film at all.

Death Wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and can't get any better than this.\\n\\nI gives this 9/10\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0089003\"}, {\"logits\": [-1.809814691543579, 2.168555736541748], \"class_probabilities\": [0.01837225630879402, 0.9816277623176575], \"class\": \"pos\", \"lime_scores\": [0.24349261212046805, 0.14101638148745319, -0.06981035229460446, -0.07475349110901848, 0.09423003800269668, -0.042336707183228496, 0.02787883879424817, 0.31065666156224403], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This movie was great.\", \"It had everything a true action fan could want.\", \"Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it.\", \"Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows.\", \"Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight.\", \"The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.\", \"Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just juices it up.\", \"This is great stuff.\"], \"text\": \"This movie was great.

But no Cohen film is resembling any other Cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.\\n\\nThe big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too.\\n\\nA film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence.

The gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to Fulci's later films however, splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close-ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great Italian horror directors.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0069019\"}, {\"logits\": [-0.543885350227356, 0.9806633591651917], \"class_probabilities\": [0.17879267036914825, 0.8212072849273682], \"class\": \"pos\", \"lime_scores\": [0.73893030746241, -0.05406766462431446, -0.021239620288255705, 0.04179884680963532, -0.009114620343720091, 0.0, 0.0017952631599992192, 0.0, -0.0015149949536175916, -0.02919155082751184, 0.057750346013409934, 0.005987467499978287], \"lime_tokens\": [\"If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.\", \"It's not Mickey Spillane for sure.\", \"There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.\", \"Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy.\", \"She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones.\", \"She also tries to tempt the local priest.\", \"Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects.\", \"You have to watch carefully to discover the killer.\", \"Can you?\", \"Don't jump on the first guy, it's way too early, and he is too obvious.\", \"Anyone familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the killer, who died a violent death at the end.\", \"What crazy reasoning he had.\"], \"text\": \"If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.\\n\\nIt's not Mickey Spillane for sure.
