This is most definitely a rental at best, just not really worth seeing it in theaters. heist \\n\\n4.8/10\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0913354\"}, {\"class\": \"neg\", \"logits\": [0.6553718077670354, 0.3446281922329646], \"lime_scores\": [0.0, -0.008636603285288908, 0.0, -0.03045995114985437, -0.03857632691911106, 0.0, -0.004474458067178815, 0.0, -0.012569787118152436, -0.021739592185658147, -0.017869834540478087, -0.020731677094847106, -0.01982579654196084, -0.013290465822238444, 0.0], \"lime_tokens\": [\"OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good\", \"so was hopeful for this film, plus with the cast line\", \"up\", \"I was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books.\", \"However I got annoyed half hour into the story...\", \"just where normal films get good, this film hit rock bottom.\", \"SPOILER\", \"*\", \"The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks.\", \"Not only that, he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short, the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death, but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother...\", \"oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths.\", \"But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour, so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire.\", \"This film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick!\", \"Ruined a good story.\", \"Shame really.\"], \"text\": \"OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film, plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books.

Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time, when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)\\n\\nReally sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0808151\"}, {\"class\": \"neg\", \"logits\": [0.5196538573159948, 0.4803461426840052], \"lime_scores\": [0.0, -0.009925772454754414, -0.002132887594880152, 0.0, 0.04159048104708788, -0.012734360761025866, -0.02033704535966351, -0.0064336944594951765, 0.006863239184855267, -0.004719696827049844, -0.06330469330850483, 0.0037081655739277693], \"lime_tokens\": [\"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind.\", \"I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book.\", \"There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code.\", \"I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book.\", \"It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating.\", \"Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level.\", \"Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer.\", \"They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work.\", \"The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol.\", \"In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about.\", \"Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller.\", \"4 out of 10\"], \"text\": \"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind.

The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something).\\n\\nThe original was a makeup effects landmark. So naturally, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the \\\"comedy\\\". It was just a total miss. If ya want a night's entertainment, go rent the original again.

There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to.\\n\\nThe film doesn't much work as a drama, either. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the story's protagonist, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock, and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0171580\"}, {\"class\": \"neg\", \"logits\": [0.8184876145969386, 0.1815123854030613], \"lime_scores\": [-0.021476992977606364, -0.0848168788268243, -0.03736973683995992, -0.016714289449694615, -0.04067537987006157, -0.025604926045930815, 0.0, -0.009612401968555466, -0.04605654236781822, -0.01135201449593562, -0.01662071645393092], \"lime_tokens\": [\"By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood.\", \"Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends.\", \"This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE!\", \"I am not joking.\", \"The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film.\", \"I know what you're saying, \\\"its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you.\\\"\", \"Well let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least bit.\", \"Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been.\", \"The acting was awful as well, along with the scariness of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off.\", \"Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up, written, produced, and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography.\", \"Please, don't see this movie, spend your $8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more worth your while.\"], \"text\": \"By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood.

Saying that, only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious.\", \"label\": \"neg\", \"url\": \"tt0284953\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.4521188507705534, 0.5478811492294466], \"lime_scores\": [-0.05385482251510669, 0.009878849937098028, 0.016437854362003988, -0.00695855124872345, 0.00997294677423473, 0.029848368778277, -0.016778203453577417, 0.007016354240677588, 0.0001480647988917205], \"lime_tokens\": [\"An awful travesty of the Greek resistance.\", \"Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English \\u0096speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!?\", \"Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series.\", \"The only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.\", \"There is some historical truth reflected in the film.\", \"People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them.\", \"Also Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign.\", \"After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans.\", \"as portrayed in the film is quite plausible, although I am not certain this actually happened.\"], \"text\": \"An awful travesty of the Greek resistance.

These three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0048347\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.4680561500614771, 0.5319438499385228], \"lime_scores\": [0.012164810162207792, -0.015286467089915124, 0.02397756015229632, 0.0003664875717521883, -0.02745509312352728, 0.02917500354723299, -0.03525264241431849], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s.\", \"Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them.\", \"Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite.\", \"From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict\", \"Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie!\", \"With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.\", \"Beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough.\"], \"text\": \"This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s.

This film suggests a satisfying compromise between Science and Religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides. \\\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\\\" A.Einstein\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0808151\"}, {\"class\": \"neg\", \"logits\": [0.5994822579384885, 0.4005177420615115], \"lime_scores\": [0.009105706874400984, 0.0, 0.008519145009624788, -0.011792679799278158, -0.024605126752861497, 0.0, -0.039345347086659196, 0.0, -0.06048209686230693, 0.03696205599658287, 0.0, -0.011447615079815088, -0.014476582639650846, -0.008319345940381317], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown.\", \"I can't say it is novel or very good\", \"but they made a movie that you can enjoy.\", \"Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though.\", \"The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing.\", \"Sound effects and sound tracks were very good.\", \"Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak.\", \"For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly.\", \"From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper.\", \"What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican.\", \"You see neither of it in the movie.\", \"Too much rush and using the time not in a good way\", \", these are main problems of the movie.\", \"So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.\"], \"text\": \"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown.

However, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't Doctor Who, please, just stay in your basement.\\n\\n10/10\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0436992\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.3028975073234353, 0.6971024926765645], \"lime_scores\": [0.003526189795525386, -0.0023843028624404403, 0.0034355222467409626, 0.010033170569334485, 0.009997195174388612, 0.05792858001641093, 0.007377697665589971, 0.01704699867449136, 0.023185989540384696, 0.0, 0.005576286154108781], \"lime_tokens\": [\"As soon as the credits rolled on Saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back!\", \"Watching those iconic moments where Christopher Eccelston met Billie Piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure.\", \"With this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked.\", \"For instence, the emotion between the Doctor and his companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series, as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return.\", \"Yet as we know, the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of Season 2 proved, he could not stay with a companion forever.\", \"Watching those moments, your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says his final farewell to the only companion he has ever loved, were moments beautifully written and acted.\", \"This show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along his lonely yet exciting journey through his never ending life.\", \"Openeing new doors and secrets every episode\", \"it's a sure show for the family to enjoy...\", \"As Christopher Eccelston once described the show...\", \"\\\"The journey of a lifetime.\\\"\"], \"text\": \"As soon as the credits rolled on Saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back!\\n\\nWatching those iconic moments where Christopher Eccelston met Billie Piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure.\\n\\nWith this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked.

The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I didn't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although before the movie he said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0384312\"}, {\"class\": \"neg\", \"logits\": [0.555932396358206, 0.444067603641794], \"lime_scores\": [-0.0007278508381470692, -0.02714429492394426, 0.003107789483216342, 0.006965051730273171, -0.010298910418210594, -0.0396580208081679, -0.025940220922498203, -0.014319904850872372, 0.017888156227961156], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This was a funny movie.\", \"Just having seeing the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and left wanting for more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including really bad ones.\", \"This one is funny, without being exceptional, but as sure as hell original.\", \"I mean you've got mad scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half brain freaks, gypsies, ex KGB cab drivers, jealousy, murders of passion, love, romance, sex, action and what more, all with the same 6 actors :)\\n\\nYou really have to see it and enjoy it\", \", I can't explain it in a text box.\", \"I guess it is not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead was, but it certainly has that Bruce Campbell touch I love.\", \"Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she has gone a long way from the hooker in Friday the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he will probably be cast as secondary character in Hollywood movies his entire career.\", \"Bottom line: funny movie.\", \"If you liked Evil Dead you'll like this, too.\"], \"text\": \"This was a funny movie.

What really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0238784\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.3505547567318135, 0.6494452432681865], \"lime_scores\": [0.0, 0.004322844518855274, 0.0, -0.004977487224407224, 0.005688395275199289, 0.006383534504511665, 0.0, -0.012948041380016215, 0.025160695840745675, -0.003125022479411304, 0.025729459858382032, 0.02354709810827124, 0.010884107838850375], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This show is really great.\", \"It's smart.\", \"It's funny.\", \"It's great acting and writing.\", \"This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen.\", \"The Dialogues are really funny and well acted.\", \"Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.\", \"You really do believe they are mother and daughter.\", \"This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.\", \"Just watch this show\", \"I highly recommend it.\", \"It's great and definitely the best show on the air.\", \"Season 7 stars Tuesday September 26th, 2006, 8/7c on the new The CW\"], \"text\": \"This show is really great.

But, still slasher fans, give this forgotten gem, i promise you, you will be staisfied!\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0082592\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.2659583386479183, 0.7340416613520817], \"lime_scores\": [0.032167241188431436, -0.010906973122845685, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01893218241458639, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0389280694746831, 0.046849640148156006, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.004885575710298844, 0.00838828423114261, 0.0, 0.01403831821435563, -0.008510147958351056, 0.01054924200225953], \"lime_tokens\": [\"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film.\", \"The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman.\", \"Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick.\", \"The cinematography is gorgeous.\", \"The acting is top notch.\", \"The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.\", \"Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind.\", \"Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.\", \"There's a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.\", \"Just Before Dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get.\", \"The killer(s) are very menacing -\", \"Almost like it's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory.\", \"The end scene is a bit off kilter.\", \"For the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking.\", \"I'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher.\", \"Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it.\", \"The setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy.\", \"The death sequences aren't particularly gory, but I'm not sure the film needed gore.\", \"See it!\"], \"text\": \"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film.

The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.\\n\\nConstance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind.

For the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking. I'd recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it.

Aside from the love story angle I thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people...government makes the decision whereas the people suffer. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake.

One of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. See, that's just the kind of guy he is. He has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater.

Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all.

When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case.\\n\\nAs if this isn't enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to care for him.\\n\\nThe acting is quite good here despite the never-ending \\\"Peyton Place\\\" like theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife.\\n\\nThe film is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. O well, the marriage ended anyway.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0369053\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.2828146841955934, 0.7171853158044066], \"lime_scores\": [0.0060388712566902605, 0.035103761036455426, 0.005271526875577534, 0.013891417191466228, 0.00794529001761419, 0.03330769049814397, 0.01028987441282277, 0.015373257436556768, 0.019050103773849077, 0.0, 0.013118551306136221, 0.0], \"lime_tokens\": [\"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels?\", \"Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England.\", \"So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven.\", \"And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication.\", \"And so the web of \\\"separate lies\\\" begins to fail and then hold together again.\", \"And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives.\", \"How many webs of deceit are to be displayed in this growing tapestry?\", \"The impulse is to prop up sterling reputations and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world.\", \"Wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and decorum, and yet humanity, of those who have much to hide.\", \"Those who desire clarity and openness on the way to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so much deception.\", \"And yet, who among us, has not something similar to hide about his loved ones?\", \"Nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this web is fated to crumble some day.\"], \"text\": \"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels?

The combination of Clooney's leading role blends well with Turturro and Nelson's supporting acts. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is great as well. This movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.\", \"label\": \"pos\", \"url\": \"tt0215002\"}, {\"class\": \"pos\", \"logits\": [0.41300884724412856, 0.5869911527558714], \"lime_scores\": [0.002626830644564435, -0.009611595155674358, 0.025951170213249962, -0.0034404016846092903, 0.01938415187378381, 0.0052120453757194705], \"lime_tokens\": [\"This film makes Clooney.\", \"All his films combined before this have all been based on the same character.\", \"This film he transcends his previous body of work and proves his capability as a top notch actor.\", \"The soundtrack defeats most one-handedly.\", \"The brothers have truly made a classic.\", \"One to own and watch repeatedly.\"], \"text\": \"This film makes Clooney.
